About me
Hello, I'm Moonno317! I have a passion for coding and enjoy exploring various programming languages and technologies. This GitHub repository serves as a showcase of my work, allowing me to share my knowledge and projects with the developer community.

Projects
In this repository, you will find a diverse range of projects I have worked on. Each project has its own dedicated directory, containing detailed documentation and instructions on how to set up and run the project. Here are some of the highlighted projects you can find:

Project A: A simple pacman game in C, like. The pacman is just a letter "C", and the ghost is "A". And the wall is "#".
Project B: I learn about stock market, so I think I will make a program to calculate stock to invest ;)
Project C: A calculator that show you how to solve the math problem
Feel free to explore these projects and provide any feedback or suggestions. I'm always open to improving and expanding upon my existing work.

In this repository, you will find a collection of code snippets that can be utilized as building blocks for your own projects. These snippets cover a wide range of programming languages and concepts, making it easier for you to find solutions to common coding challenges.

Resources
Apart from my own projects and code snippets, I have also compiled a list of resources that I find valuable, including tutorials, articles, and helpful tools. These resources can aid you in your coding journey and provide additional insights into various topics. Feel free to explore and utilize these resources to enhance your programming skills.
